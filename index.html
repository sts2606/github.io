                            <p class="feedback-item-text">Anna’s sincerity, professionalism, and honest business ethics puts a whole new meaning to the title “Professional Matchmaker”. If you are seriously looking for a woman who will be a compatible life partner, Annabelle Marriage agency should be your first choice when you go to Ukraine. Her agency’s approach in ensuring that you do not go to Ukraine to waste your time and hard-earned money is almost fool-proof. Listen to Anna’s advice and recommendations - she knows what she is doing, and she is not after your money. Finding a compatible match between a foreign man and a Ukrainian woman is her business’ primary goal and everything else comes second. All the ladies in her agency who were interested in meeting me were well-educated, beautiful, and sincere in their request as well. These ladies are looking for a decent man that they will be compatible with - a man who will become a good husband in the future. So, if you have this one simple quality, just apply on her site, plan a visit to Ukraine, and you could soon meet the woman of your dream. As for me, I plan to return to Ukraine again soon to continue the relationships that she helped to develop. Thank you again Anna!!!

                        <p class="story-body">Hi everyone! I am Dan from the US. Wow, I really want to tell my story of date to Ukrainian lady to ya’ll! I have an old friend, I know him from school – his name’s Mike. He got married a couple of years ago – and it would seem okay if not that fact that he got married to a girl from Ukraine!<br>
                            <br>He used to work in Ukraine for a couple of years – and he met his future wife there. Basically speaking, I liked this lady so much that I’ve decided for myself the same – I want to find a woman for me from Ukraine too!<br><br>This Ukrainian was so delightful, you know – everything was perfect – the outward appearance, character, temperament… OMG, how tasty was her cookery! Ukrainian cookery is the most delicious! So I went to Kiev. Well, for nothing, of course. I was there twice – but did not manage to find anyone I was looking for. I chatted with Ukrainian ladies in chats and wedding sites – and I even sent some money and gifts to some of them. I contacted one marriage agency in Ukraine and they even told they found me a pair. When I came to Ukrainian airport, nobody met me there, nobody answered the phone calls… They deceived me, in a few words as I already paid them money for the service.<br><br>Well, so here I was – in despair to find a wife from Ukraine. Do you know who had helped me? Mike! The same old bro Mike who gave me the helpful service! Is it turned out, he did not meet his bride (wife now) on the street or a date in some bar just like that but through the Ukrainian matchmaking marriage agency located in Kiev – they did this service for over 10 years or so. So he gave me the contacts of Anna – its director – to arrange a separate date for me. But, you know, I was highly skeptical about that – as my previous negative experience has been whispering me and the words seemed reasonable. However, thinking that I would not lose anything, I’ve decided to try. And for the reason!<br><br>
    I contacted this marriage company and told I was looking for a wife. The director was one of the most understanding people ever. She had demonstrated me a completely professional approach. What we did during her service:<br><br>
    have been talking a lot – to make it possible for her to make an impression and a profile of me for Ukrainian matches filled in the questionnaire for a man (one expecting to become a husband)
    browsed through pictures of many candidates found out what I generally wanted from life and beloved wife. It may seem odd but I even felt that I was at a psychologist – not in the marriage agency from Ukraine to turn from single to non-single. It turned out that the professionals in matchmaking work exactly like this – come to know everything about me to make the perfect selection of the future bride. It also turned out such approach was devastatingly effective to create a family!<br><br>
    The next time I had an international flight to Ukrainian Kyiv, the result was tremendous: from ten girls, potential brides, offered by Anna, I finally selected two and had dates. The second bride was my ideal – beautiful partner, easy in communication, and with light character. I flew to her two more times and, finally, she agreed to fly with me in the US. We have already wed and we’re now waiting for a child!<br><br>
    I want to thank separately to family-oriented Anna and her agency as she has a super serious approach to the business. What is important above everything – this marriage agency strives to the result (a wedding), not accentuating on the process (like paid meetings arranged by other so-called marriage agencies in Ukraine). So everything turned out ideal for me!</p>

                        <h5 class="story-title">Story Igor</h5>
                        <p class="story-body">My name is Igor. I’m from Ukraine. I would never think that, living in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, I would turn to a marriage agency to find the bride from that very same country and Ukrainian city. As simple as it may be – to find a lady in Ukraine when you are going to a park, cafeteria, library or a club to meet a single woman. The problem is that it takes a lot of time. I earn well but the business I do takes all my time and I can’t spare anything for searches for a bride. Not speaking about finding ‘the one’. <br><br>


                            So I turned for help looking for a bride to the service of Ukrainian segment of the international World Wide Web. There turned out a huge amount of Ukrainian marriage agencies and it was really hard to stop my choice on at least any of them. Somehow I selected the marriage agency “Annabel” from Ukraine. Maybe, because of their unique offer: they promised to pick the wife based on the psychological portrait and temperament – and to do it fast. They also asked to pay them only once – for the entire circle that ended with the wedding. That really profitably highlighted them from all other bride marriage agencies in Ukraine that only demanded money for everything: registration, meetings, viewing girls’ profiles, more dates, and so on. There were such matchmakers in Ukraine that asked to buy presents for every girl even before I selected anyone. This is a real deception already, you know. So, anyway, my selection of Annabel turned out truthful. <br><br>
                            When I contacted Anna, the director of it, we have had a long questionnaire stage and talking – it seemed to me I went not to a Ukrainian marriage matchmaking agency but to some shrink – as they, amongst other, asked me about childhood, parents, and work in Ukraine. But in return, they offered me to select the pair pretty soon. It also turned out that there was an appropriate girl on the database of the agency – and she’s been waiting for quite a time to meet her man to make him a husband. I liked this Ukrainian from the picture already. But after our first date, I understood right there that I didn’t need any Ukrainian matchmaking service no more. I fell in love. However, Lena was not so sure about the family with me, and the marriage thing in general, so it took several more dates for her to raise the assuredness in me. But it was just a technical question, I think, as I really liked this Ukrainian lady. As if I met a soulmate. <br><br>

                            It took a couple of months for us to understand that this is love, I want to be married to her, and all we wanted is to be together forever. So we did not wait for too long – and selected the day of our marriage. <br> <br>
                            It is almost like magic to me – how did Anna manage to define my second half so precisely… This is a separate talent, you know, much more than just a Ukrainian service! I’ve never felt such emotions towards anyone whom I've been dating with. Now I feel really happy – words can’t say it! <br><br>
                            So, I give my huge “Thanks” to the Ukrainian family-oriented matchmaking service agency ‘Annabel’ and Anna from Ukraine personally that they were able to set my destiny with the right partner onto new rails, giving me such astounding result!</p>

                        <p class="story-body">Hello, everyone! My name’s Victor. I am from Ukraine but life had thrown me really far from Ukrainian home. Now I live in Australia, where I do business. I have to say, I do it pretty effectively even judging by the world standards, not only Ukrainian or Australian. <br><br>

                            The problem had appeared from where I did not expect it – my loneliness started to kill me. I also wanted to direct the money I earned into some creative, positive stream. Well, basically speaking, I needed a family and home coziness. However, I was not attracted to the local women. Also, I did not have time to fly around to different countries to start affairs. <br>
                            
                            I wanted my wife to be Ukrainian too. First of all, I would hear my mother tongue more often and a girl would be similar to me in mentality. However, my service kept me in the place. My business is gradually growing, takes pace, and <br><br>
                            
                            Luckily for me, I was able to find a solution: marriage agency “Annabel’” from Ukraine. As strange as it may sound, but I was advised to try it by my Ukrainian friend. We chatted with him one day and this theme just resurfaced. And so he told me one his good friend found a wife in this way. I am naturally skeptical of such matchmaking marriage agencies. But, after I spoke with the director of this international bride service agency, I have learned three things: <br><br>
                            
                            first – I will not be obliged to pay for every meeting with a potential bride neither I will have to make gifts to girls <br><br>
                            second – when I fly to Ukraine, I will have acquaintances with several girls-brides at once and so I will not be obliged to repeat, going back here in a month or other time <br><br>
                            third – Anna (the director) is a very goal-oriented and family-oriented person, she wants to make sure the marriage service for me as a client, not endless shallow dates in Kiev with all sorts of single ladies. <br><br>
                            Well, eventually, I’ve decided to entrust myself to the professional Ukrainian love matchmaker and just go for it. I did not regret (though I did not put too many hopes). Ukrainian women who wanted to become married were selected for me based on theirs and my profiles. Anna was preparing me for the dates with those ladies from Ukraine personally. This was really helpful for me as I wasn’t in Ukraine for a long time now and things have changed. Well, anyway, after bride Tatyana came, I understood that I was lost in her eyes right on that date. That’s it – she was the one. <br><br>
                            
                            We’ve spent several super lovely days together. It is hard to imagine someone more matching me than her. Tatyana agreed to go to Australia not at once. But she’s now here with me and is already preparing for the upcoming wedding. <br><br>
                            
                            In the work of Ukrainian marriage agency ‘Annabel’, I want to highlight most of all its business approach: maximum concentration on searching of a suitable partner for a man, and minimal time required to find the right family member. I am really amazed how precise the woman was matched for me based on my type – stunning! Anyway – thank you for finding my whole-life partner just for a couple of months! I’ll be a great husband for her.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <h5 class="story-title">Story Mike</h5>
                        <p class="story-body">Hey, there! My name’s Mike and I am happy. Does it sound for you like a guy talking on some ‘anonymous psychological support’ thing? Well, yep. But I just can’t say it otherwise. Anna from Ukraine asked me to write a feedback for her marriage agency called ‘Annabel’ – the place, to which I have addressed to after several fruitless years of vain searching trying to find a wife from Ukraine. <br><br>

                            It is hard to recall now how it all started. I can say for sure that I’ve spent thousands of dollars on various matchmaking sites. Of course, I paid money for such services as the registration and access to profiles, and the most part, aside from these services, went to gifts to ladies and lettering with them. <br><br>
                            
                            Seriously – I’d been told such stories by those singles and had been given such promises that it was hard not to believe them. But after all, it all turned to dust – for girls, it was just a business. When the thing was about having a date – they all just vanished. <br><br>
                            
                            Sometime after that, I found ‘Annabel’ internationally-working agency located in Ukraine. So I’ve decided then their service would be the last attempt to find a life partner from Western Europe (Ukraine if possible). If they again pumped money out of me – I would just quit. The most entangling fact for me was that I had to pay only once – but instead, they have promised me to work until the very end – to the wedding. <br><br>
                            
                            Looking ahead, I must tell you – that’s exactly what had happened with this agency – and it took much fewer time than I have expected from this Ukrainian service agency. <br><br>
                            
                            They simply talked with me. According to Anna’s words, this is how they used to do the psychological portrait of me. After that, she started to select the proper Ukrainian candidates for the marriage. Finally, I was offered 10 girls but also they specifically insisted on dating Kristina. Sure, this Ukrainian looked astounding in the picture but I stopped believing pictures a long time ago. I didn’t care too much for the queue of meetings in Ukraine – and, as they offered me to meet Kristina first – what the hell, why not. <br><br>
                            
                            So, I arrived in Kiev, not expecting at first a result they’ve promised – a marriage. It was the first visit in this city for me (not just for brides but at all), the capital of Ukraine. They met me at the airport and drove to my hotel. They also gave me the final briefing (if I can call it like that) before dates with potential brides – despite the fact the Anna gave me a lot of master classes how to speak with Ukrainian brides-women. For free, I must say! <br><br>
                            
                            Well – what do you know – I only had one date in Ukraine. The reason for that was simple – I just didn’t need to meet the other Ukrainian girls! They managed to match so marvelous girl for me that I fell in love with this my future partner right from the first sight! This was far greater than just ‘WOW’ – it was like, I don’t know, a ‘sparkle’, an ‘insanity’, ‘frenzy’! I’ve literally never felt so big emotional energy, not even once in my life! <br><br>
                            
                            Kristina from this Ukrainian marriage company turned out a great in appearance and inside – smart, a perfect interlocutor and finest bride, as I found out later. Even more – she was just as I expected her to be in character and temperament. We had the greatest weekend ever and so I completely forgot about all other girls – as Kristina was the one  <br><br>
                            
                            Recently, we’ve celebrated the 1st anniversary as we’re married as a husband and wife. We live as very close people and we’re in the midst of preparation for the replenishment in our family! I wanna give a huge thanks to this Ukrainian family-oriented bride-finding marriage agency for all the work they have done – the result was beyond everything I could expect. I will definitely recommend Ukrainian marriage agency ‘Annabel’ to a few men friends – as I got really tired to answer where did I manage to find such an astounding Ukrainian lady as Kristina!</p>
