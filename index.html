                    <h5 class="story-title">Story Dan</h5>
                    <p class="story-body">Hi everyone! I am Dan from the US. Wow, I really want to tell my story of date to Ukrainian lady to ya’ll! I have an old friend, I know him from school – his name’s Mike. He got married a couple of years ago – and it would seem okay if not that fact that he got married to a girl from Ukraine!<br>
                        <br>He used to work in Ukraine for a couple of years – and he met his future wife there. Basically speaking, I liked this lady so much that I’ve decided for myself the same – I want to find a woman for me from Ukraine too!<br><br>This Ukrainian was so delightful, you know – everything was perfect – the outward appearance, character, temperament… OMG, how tasty was her cookery! Ukrainian cookery is the most delicious! So I went to Kiev. Well, for nothing, of course. I was there twice – but did not manage to find anyone I was looking for. I chatted with Ukrainian ladies in chats and wedding sites – and I even sent some money and gifts to some of them. I contacted one marriage agency in Ukraine and they even told they found me a pair. When I came to Ukrainian airport, nobody met me there, nobody answered the phone calls… They deceived me, in a few words as I already paid them money for the service.<br><br>Well, so here I was – in despair to find a wife from Ukraine. Do you know who had helped me? Mike! The same old bro Mike who gave me the helpful service! Is it turned out, he did not meet his bride (wife now) on the street or a date in some bar just like that but through the Ukrainian matchmaking marriage agency located in Kiev – they did this service for over 10 years or so. So he gave me the contacts of Anna – its director – to arrange a separate date for me. But, you know, I was highly skeptical about that – as my previous negative experience has been whispering me and the words seemed reasonable. However, thinking that I would not lose anything, I’ve decided to try. And for the reason!<br><br>
I contacted this marriage company and told I was looking for a wife. The director was one of the most understanding people ever. She had demonstrated me a completely professional approach. What we did during her service:<br><br>
have been talking a lot – to make it possible for her to make an impression and a profile of me for Ukrainian matches filled in the questionnaire for a man (one expecting to become a husband)
browsed through pictures of many candidates found out what I generally wanted from life and beloved wife. It may seem odd but I even felt that I was at a psychologist – not in the marriage agency from Ukraine to turn from single to non-single. It turned out that the professionals in matchmaking work exactly like this – come to know everything about me to make the perfect selection of the future bride. It also turned out such approach was devastatingly effective to create a family!<br><br>
The next time I had an international flight to Ukrainian Kyiv, the result was tremendous: from ten girls, potential brides, offered by Anna, I finally selected two and had dates. The second bride was my ideal – beautiful partner, easy in communication, and with light character. I flew to her two more times and, finally, she agreed to fly with me in the US. We have already wed and we’re now waiting for a child!<br><br>
I want to thank separately to family-oriented Anna and her agency as she has a super serious approach to the business. What is important above everything – this marriage agency strives to the result (a wedding), not accentuating on the process (like paid meetings arranged by other so-called marriage agencies in Ukraine). So everything turned out ideal for me!</p>
